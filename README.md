# company-organizer
The company-organizer is a command line application that connects to a locally hosted database. It allows the user the ability to create and view departments, roles, and employees. In addition to this, it allows the user to update the employee's role.

## What was the point?
The point of this application is to give the user the ability to manage a company's employees, roles, and departments stored on a locally hosted database. For me, the point was to get some experience hosting a MySql database as well as some work with the <a href="https://github.com/sidorares/node-mysql2">mysql2</a> node package.

## Lessons Learned
This was some of the most I've gotten to work with Promises and async functions so there was a bit of a learning curve there. I'm definitely more familiar with it but still plenty of room to improve.

## Usage Information
Of course! Take a look at the video below which will get you started!\
